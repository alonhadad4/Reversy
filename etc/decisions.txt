made by alon hadad 204566871 and jonathan berger 308120930

Choosing a design:
We chose jonathan's design because:
	* He had many interfaces for future development that would save us planty of time
	* We didnt combine alon's logic because of missmatching in the unit system. jonathan used a point class and alon worked with integers
	* We used git to push and pull our progress and then submited the final stage of our project.
Cons:
	Alon's:
		* Lack of interfaces
		* Not using vectors
	Jonathan's:
		* incorrect point notations (-1)
		* point comperator
Pros:
	Alon's:
		* Strong Logic
		* values efficiency
	Jonathan's:
		* Many interfaces
		* very orgenized
